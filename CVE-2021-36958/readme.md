# CVE-2021-36958

Derived the analysis of exploitation activity can highlight the following events points to this one:

During the connection process of "Pick and Print" driver occurs querying of driver keys ( RPC EnumPrinterKey ). Further when key "CopyFile" is found happens to retrieve key data ( RPC EnumPrinterDataEx ) and among responses observes values 'Files' that contains DLL file name and 'TargerDir' contains 'X64\3' ( for x64 ) or 'W32X86\3' ( for x86 ).
Observing a key "CopyFiles" with value "Module" equals to value "File" from any previous one

How noted [1] @gentilkiwi mechanism of attack is similar to "old printnightmare with DataFile and ConfigFile"

Attacker can upload ( and even replace existing one in "\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\" ) needed dll via CopyFile 'Files' and execute via 'Module' from another
